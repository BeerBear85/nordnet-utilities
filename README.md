Utilities for extracting data from Nordnet
==========================================

These utilities will let you extract transaction, stock price and/or currency data from Nordnet (see https://nordnet.dk). 

Getting started
===============

Step one
--------

* Edit `nordnet_configuration_example.py` with your account details and save it as `nordnet_configuration.py`. Feel free to edit other options as well while you're at it.

Step two
--------

* Run either of `nordnet_get_transactions.py`, `nordnet_get_stock_prices_no_login.py` `nordnet_get_currencies.py`, or  `nordnet_get_performance_graph.py` to get the data you are interested in.
